# What is Smart Money?

If you're looking for investment advice, talk to a financial advisor. You won’t find specific investment recommendations here. Instead, this tutorial is about making smart, practical decisions that can set you on the path to long‑term wealth accumulation.

Let’s start with a simple question: if your goal is to build wealth, is it smarter to spend $7 on a daily latte—or to invest that same $7 each day toward your future? The answer should be obvious.

But this tutorial isn’t really about lattes. It’s about concepts that unfold over years—or even generations. These strategies aren’t complicated, and they don’t require a finance degree or a background in wealth management. What they do require is a basic grasp of math and a willingness to think just a little __outside the box__.

Don’t be put off by that phrase — “outside the box.” None of the strategies here are radical or risky. More likely, you’ll find yourself wondering, “Why didn’t I think of that?” or “Why hasn’t my advisor ever mentioned this?”

Consider Mary’s 10‑year‑old daughter, Madison. She walks the neighbor’s dog and earns $10 for every half‑hour walk. That’s earned income—and it makes her eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. Is Madison actually contributing to one? Probably not. Is Mary making a contribution on Madison’s behalf? Also unlikely. Yet even a very small Roth contribution today could grow into hundreds of thousands—maybe even millions—of dollars in tax‑free retirement savings by the time Madison retires.
