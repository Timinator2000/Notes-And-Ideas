# Introduction to Wealth Classification

For the purposes of financial and retirement planning in the United States, an individual's wealth can often be categorized into three primary types: non-qualified, qualified (traditional), and qualified (Roth) accounts. While this framework effectively captures most financial assets, certain forms of wealth—such as private business equity or non-financial assets like collectibles—may not fit neatly into these categories. This tutorial assumes the majority of an individual’s wealth can be classified into one of these three types, providing a foundation for understanding smart-money strategies. Below, each classification is explained separately:

* **Non-Qualified Accounts**: These encompass assets held outside of tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, real estate, or personal property (e.g., vehicles, jewelry). Non-qualified assets do not receive special tax treatment, meaning earnings like interest, dividends, or capital gains are typically subject to taxes in the year they are realized. This category is broad and includes most forms of wealth not specifically designated for retirement under IRS rules, offering flexibility in access but no tax deferral or exemption.

* **Qualified (Traditional) Accounts**: These are retirement accounts that meet IRS regulations for tax-deferred growth, such as traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or similar plans. Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible, reducing taxable income in the year of contribution. The investments grow tax-deferred, meaning no taxes are owed on earnings until funds are withdrawn, typically in retirement. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and early withdrawals before age 59½ may incur penalties, making these accounts suited for long-term retirement planning.

* **Qualified (Roth) Accounts**: These include retirement accounts like Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which also comply with IRS rules but differ in tax treatment. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning no tax deduction is available at the time of contribution. However, qualified withdrawals—typically after age 59½ and a five-year holding period—are entirely tax-free, including both contributions and earnings. This makes Roth accounts advantageous for individuals anticipating higher tax rates in retirement or seeking tax-free income, provided they meet the qualification criteria.

# What About Trust Accounts?

Trusts, such as living trusts or irrevocable trusts, are legal entities that can own assets, including accounts classified as non-qualified, qualified (traditional), or qualified (Roth). For example, a living trust might hold a taxable brokerage account (non-qualified), while an irrevocable trust could own a taxable brokerage account or an inherited IRA (traditional or Roth).

The introduction of trusts does not alter the three classifications above, as the tax treatment of the accounts remains the same regardless of ownership structure. However, trusts can impact tax and estate planning by offering benefits like probate avoidance (living trusts) or creditor protection (irrevocable trusts), which may influence how assets are held within the three categories. Always consult a tax or legal professional to align trust strategies with your financial goals.
