1 | Why “Asset Location” Deserves as Much Attention as Asset Allocation
Most investors stop at risk profile—how much stock‑market risk (70 % equities / 30 % fixed income in this paper) they can stomach. Yet where each slice sits—asset location—often delivers a quieter but surprisingly large payoff:

Account wrapper	Taxes while growing	Taxes when withdrawn	Conceptual “best home” for…
Roth IRA / Roth 401(k)	0 %	0 %	Highest‑octane growth assets
Traditional 401(k), SEP‑IRA, etc.	Tax‑deferred	Ordinary income	Next‑highest growth (preserves Roth‑conversion option) + core bonds
Taxable brokerage	Ongoing taxes on dividends/gains	Capital‑gains rates	Only after tax‑advantaged space is stuffed; focus on tax‑efficient ETFs/munis

Because Roth dollars will never be taxed again, every extra percentage point of return compounds untouched—making location every bit as powerful as traditional stock‑bond diversification.
