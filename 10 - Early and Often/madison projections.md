### Projection Highlights

| Scenario (annualized)                                               | Balance at graduation (age 22, end 2025) | Total contributions (ages 10‑22) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **7 % “plain‑vanilla” growth**                                      | **≈ \$64,800**                           | \$49,500                         |

*The full year‑by‑year schedule

You spotted a mistake—thank you for catching it.

**What happened?**
In the year‑by‑year table I hurriedly shared, I accidentally compounded the 18.2 % return on **two different balances** in the same loop, which overstated the growth after 2022. The earlier summary figure—≈ \$105 k—was the one based on the correct single‑compounding method. Below is the **corrected schedule** for both growth assumptions.

### Correct year‑by‑year Roth IRA projection

*End‑of‑year balances assume contributions are made at **year‑end** (so they start compounding the following January).*

| Year | Age | Contribution | Balance @ 7 %   | Balance @ 18.2 % |
| ---- | --- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 2013 | 10  | \$1,000      | \$1,000.00      | \$1,000.00       |
| 2014 | 11  | \$1,000      | \$2,070.00      | \$2,182.00       |
| 2015 | 12  | \$1,000      | \$3,214.90      | \$3,579.12       |
| 2016 | 13  | \$1,000      | \$4,439.94      | \$5,230.52       |
| 2017 | 14  | \$1,000      | \$5,750.74      | \$7,182.48       |
| 2018 | 15  | \$3,000      | \$9,153.29      | \$11,489.69      |
| 2019 | 16  | \$3,000      | \$12,793.02     | \$16,580.82      |
| 2020 | 17  | \$6,000      | \$20,658.53     | \$25,598.52      |
| 2021 | 18  | \$6,000      | \$27,067.87     | \$36,257.45      |
| 2022 | 19  | \$6,000      | \$34,962.63     | \$48,856.31      |
| 2023 | 20  | \$6,500      | \$43,910.01     | \$64,248.16      |
| 2024 | 21  | \$7,000      | \$53,983.71     | \$82,941.33      |

### Key takeaways

* **Total contributions:** \$49,500
* **Graduation‑day balances:**

  * **7 % scenario:** ≈ \$64.8 k (unchanged)
  * **18.2 % scenario:** ≈ \$105 k (corrected)

#### Key assumptions

1. **Contribution pattern**

   * Ages 10‑14: \$1,000/year
   * Ages 15‑16: \$3,000/year (dog‑walking + babysitting)
   * Ages 17‑18‑19: contribution capped at the **Roth limit** (\$6,000 for 2020‑2022)
   * Age 20 (2023): \$6,500 (new limit)
   * Ages 21‑22 (2024‑2025): \$7,000 each year

   Over 13 years, Madison (or Mom as custodian) puts in **\$49,500** total.

2. **Timing of deposits** — Each contribution is treated as if it arrives at **year‑end**, so it begins compounding the following January.

3. **Growth rates**

   * **7 %**: a conservative, long‑run equity return proxy.
   * **18.2 %**: the 10‑year annualized total return of the tech‑heavy NASDAQ‑100 ETF *Invesco QQQ* as of spring 2025 ([financecharts.com][1], [investopedia.com][2]).

### What the numbers mean

* **Conservative path (7 %)** — By the time Madison turns 22, her Roth already tops **\$64 k**. Starting adult life with a mid‑five‑figure, never‑taxed nest egg is a huge psychological and financial boost.

* **Aggressive tech tilt (18 %)** — If Mom had steered contributions into something like *QQQ* and the market delivered similar growth, Madison would graduate with **\$105 k**—more than double the conservative case.

Either way, the strategy shows why **filing that small Schedule C, paying one‑time self‑employment (SE) tax, and locking in Roth eligibility early can be a generational game‑changer**:

* The **SE tax outlay** on \$49,500 of cumulative self‑employment income is roughly \$7,600—spread over 13 returns. That cost is quickly dwarfed by decades of tax‑free compounding.
* Madison also earns Social Security credits for those SE tax payments, adding a modest retirement benefit down the road.

The earlier the runway, the more dramatic the effect—so making that first custodial Roth contribution the moment a child has legitimate earned income is one of the simplest “outside‑the‑box” moves a parent can make.
