# Max Fund Your Traditional 401(k) and Possibly Convert to Roth

If your 401(k) plan doesn’t offer a Roth option, you can still pursue a powerful strategy to shift money from taxable savings into a tax-free Roth environment. Using the same assumptions as before—$500,000 in non-qualified (taxable) savings, $100,000 of taxable income, and no retirement account balances—you begin by maxing out your traditional 401(k) contributions. For someone over age 50, that means contributing $31,000 in 2025. This reduces your take-home pay by $31,000 but also lowers your taxable income from $100,000 to $69,000. To maintain your lifestyle, you use $31,000 from your savings to supplement your reduced take-home pay, keeping your total spending power exactly where it was before. You've essentially moved $31,000 from a taxable environment into a tax-deferred one—without sacrificing anything in the short term.
